A comprehensive and effective approach to marketing requires a solid strategy that is well-thought-of, consistent, and planned and includes sharing valuable content. Social media which aims at increasing brand awareness and providing a direct channel to connect to the audience should be implemented on a regular basis. One of the tools to keep social media presence consistent for REALTORS® is a social media content calendar for real estate.

Once you have the great content your audience needs you can start posting them on social media in a regular fashion. Social media content calendars help you achieve consistency and keep a steady presence on social media. If you fail to show up regularly on your social media channels and talk to your audience, somebody else will and you do not want that to happen.
